## Description

This project will allow you to generate a professional quality Readme file for your GitHub projects. It is important to provide a thorough readme for all of your work, and this makes the process quick and easy, and makes sure you include all of the information that is required. Creating this project gave me the opportunity to work with Inquirer.js and to experiment with the different prompt types, as well as wrapping them in functions to provide multiline answers to certain prompts. This creates a clean and functional readme file every time, and hopefully will save others time as well.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.
